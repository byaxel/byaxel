## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student of Cross-Platform Application Development at BirtLH in the Basque Country, and in my spare time, I am learning to develop iOS applications. Technology has always been my passion, and for over four years, I worked at Apple, helping people with software issues and teaching them how to use applications. This experience sparked a deep interest in app development, and in 2023, I decided to fully dedicate myself to studying programming, focusing on turning this passion into my professional career.

In addition to my formal education, I am self-learning Swift and SwiftUI to further refine my skills and specialize in developing applications for the Apple platform. I dedicate my free time to constantly improving my knowledge in this area. When Iâ€™m not programming, youâ€™ll find me traveling, staying up way too late to finish a book that wonâ€™t let me sleep, or taking care of my two little dragons, Moon and Melo (my cats).

I am eager to contribute to exciting projects and continue growing as a developer.
